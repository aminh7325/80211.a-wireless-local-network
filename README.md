+ Phase 1: developed Scrambler and Descrambler in Verilog and
Matlab and verified the design using a test bench provided by
myself.

+ Phase 2: developed Encoder and Decoder ( Viterbi algorithm )
in Verilog and Matlab and verified the design using a test
bench.

+ Phase 3: developed Interleaver and Deinterleaver in Verilog
and Matlab and verified the design using a test bench.

+ Phase 4: Combining these three Modules, We could finally test
the transmitter as well as the receiver using another test
bench.
